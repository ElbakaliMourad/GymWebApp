				You've probably heard of Lorem Ipsum before - it's the most-used dummy text excerpt out there. 
				People use it because it has a fairly normal distribution of letters and words (making it look
				like normal English), but it's also Latin, which means your average	reader won't get distracted 
				by trying to read it. <br><br>
				It's perfect for showcasing design work as it should look when fleshed out with text, because 
				it allows viewers to focus on the design work itself, instead of the text. It's also a great 
				way to showcase the functionality of programs like word processors, font types, and	more. <br><br>
				Morbi in sem quis dui placerat ornare. Pellentesque odio nisi, euismod in, pharetra a, ultricies 
				in, diam. Sed arcu. Cras consequat. Praesent dapibus, neque id cursus faucibus, tortor neque
				egestas augue, eu vulputate magna eros eu erat. Aliquam erat volutpat. <br><br>
				Nam dui mi, tincidunt quis, accumsan porttitor, facilisis luctus, metus. Phasellus ultrices 
				nulla quis nibh. Quisque a lectus. Donec consectetuer ligula vulputate sem tristique cursus. 
				Nam nulla quam, gravida non, commodo a, sodales sit amet, nisi. <br><br>
				Pellentesque fermentum dolor. Aliquam quam lectus, facilisis auctor, ultrices ut, elementum 
				vulputate, nunc. We've taken Lorem Ipsum to the next level with our HTML-Ipsum tool. <br><br>
				As you can see, this Lorem Ipsum is tailor-made for websites and other online projects that are 
				based in HTML. Most web design projects use Lorem Ipsum excerpts to begin with, but you always 
				have to spend an annoying extra minute or two
				formatting it properly for the web. <br><br>
